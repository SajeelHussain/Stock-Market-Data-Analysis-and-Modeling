# Stock-Market-Data-Analysis-and-Modeling
This project analyzes stock market data to predict VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) using Python (Pandas, NumPy, ARIMA). Data is cleaned, and features like high, low, volume, and trades are used to create lag-based features. The ARIMA model forecasts VWAP, with performance evaluated using MAE, MSE, and R-squared metrics.
